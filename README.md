My PHP Resume and Portfolio
===
Here is the source code to my one-page resume website.
I tried to implement as many of my skills as possible: HTML, CSS, Photoshop (for header image), my own custom PHP Model-View-Controller framework, AJAX & JSON

If you like what you see, my contact information is listed at the bottom of the live website at https://ericturner.it!


Inspirations & Resources
====
When performing my yearly refresh, I like to take a look on the web at design trends and try to implement them myself.
Here's two websites that really inspired me and I tried to merge the design of both for my new resume:
* Pascal van Gemert's One-Page Resume: http://www.pascalvangemert.nl/
* Octa Website Template: https://themeforest.net/item/octa-multipurpose-html-template/20891153

Resources:
* Font: Nunito: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nunito
* Background Gradient: https://uigradients.com/#CoolSky
* Perspective MacBook Mockup Template: https://graphicriver.net/item/perspective-macbook-screen-mockup/21071639?ref=graphicgata
